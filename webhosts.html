<h2>
<p>I would chose the webhost Bluehost because of its more affordable prices and the many options that it provides. All of the
options were about the same price but all the options were "offering" lower prices because of a sale which is misleading because
after the first year the prices were not the same but get more expensive. I think bluehost has the most to offer for its prices because
they a little bit cheaper and I am all about saving every penny. I don't know why everthing after the GoDaddy section became linked but it just happened.</p>
