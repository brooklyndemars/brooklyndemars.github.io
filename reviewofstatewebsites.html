  <h1>Ranking of State Websites</h1>
  <ol class="width:30px">
    <li>Favorite State Website</li>
    <p>Visit<a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov" target="_blank"> Arkansas</a></p>
    <p> This is my favorite of all the state websites because it is very easy to navigate.
     The color scheme is soothing to the eyes and the layout seems organized and not cluttered. The website is mobile friendly. I
      could find everything as if I was a citizen of the state, with ease. The search bar was in a very noticable
      location and was not hidden like some other websites. The website does not take forever to load anything. The website loaded really quickly and did not buffer when trying to
    load into a new window or page.</p>
    <li>That State</li>
    <p>Visit<a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"> Maryland</a></p>
    <p>This is my second favorite website because it is very similar to the Arkansas state website.
      This website loaded really quickly between different pages or opening into a new window.
      I really liked the color scheme for this website with incorporating the red which helped it stand out to me and made the website intriguing.
      Website is mobile friendly. This website was very easy to navigate and find resources that are
      avaible to the people of this state. </p>
    <li>Red State</li>
    <p>Visit<a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html" target="_blank"> Maine</a></p>
    <p>The Maine state website seemed really average to me, nothing really stood out. The color scheme
      was not pleasing nor displeasing because there really is not one. The site was just a white background with different colored fonts to match with some of the box background around the header.
      The load times were not super fast or slow. The layout was a
      little bit cluttered. I did like the photographs used for some of the backgrounds but other than that
      the website just seemed really average. </p>
    <li>Blue State</li>
    <p>Visit<a href="https://alaska.gov" target="_blank"> Alaska</a></p>
    <p>The Alaska website is my second to least favorite website because
      the colors are not pleasing, they are really dull and when changing screen sizes the website is not
      mobile compatible. The layout of the website is very cluttered and the site is somewhat
      managable to navigate but it could be a lot more simple. </p>
    <li>Least Favorite State Website</li>
    <p>Visit<a href="https://portal.kansas.gov" target="_blank"> Kansas</a></p>
    <p>The Kansas state website is my least favorite website because the website
      is very confusing to use because there is no menu or drop downs. The website
      just has a search bar to navigate the entire website which is hard to find exaclty what your looking for.
      However the background of the website is really cool but that is about the only thing that I like about
      this wesite since they used a mural. This website is mobile friendly but overall this website
    is really difficult to navigate. </p>
